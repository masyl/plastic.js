Manipulate your data with a fluent API (Data Ã  la jQuery)

## Project status

This project is still under development. You should not use it for production purposes yet.

## Introduction

Not yet...

## Tests

Even if the tests are not extensive yet, I try to keep the test coverage at 100%.
You can use expesso to run the tests. The "lib-cov" folder contains the instrumented
version of the code in order to obtain the code-coverage report during tests.

### Test commands
- rm -rf lib-cov
- node-jscoverage lib lib-cov
- expresso
